# Computer-Networks-I-Assignment
This is a small application developed as part of the course "Computer Networks I" at ECE AUTH. 

The purpose was to make a serial communication app in Java. This was achieved with establishing a connection with "Ithaki Lab" server sending requests(byte-byte) for packages and receiving them. For the communication with "Ithaki" a .jar library is needed and we were asked to run two separate sessions which were at least 48 hours apart. One of the sessions with the images received and the generated graphs is displayed in this repository(session1.pdf).

The repository also includes a small MATLAB script made to generate the graphs asked for the report of the assignment.
